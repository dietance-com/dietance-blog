### **Instructions**

1.  Preheat your oven to 400째F (200째C).
    
2.  In a large bowl, combine the halved potatoes, smashed garlic cloves, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, chopped rosemary, oregano, paprika, and a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Toss until the potatoes are evenly coated.
    
3.  Spread the seasoned potatoes and garlic in a single layer on a large baking sheet.
    
4.  Pat the chicken pieces dry with a paper towel. Drizzle the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil over the chicken and season with salt and pepper.
    
5.  Arrange the chicken pieces among the potatoes on the baking sheet. Place the lemon slices on top of and around the chicken.
    
6.  Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the potatoes are tender and golden. The internal temperature of the chicken should reach 165째F (74째C).
    
7.  Let the dish rest for a few minutes before serving.
    

**Tip:** For extra flavor and crispy skin on bone-in chicken, use bone-in, skin-on thighs and broil for the last 2-3 minutes of cooking.
